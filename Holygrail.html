        <h2> Nigeria</h2>
        <img src="images/Map.png" alt="Map of Nigeria">
        <p>Nigeria, country located on the western coast of Africa. Nigeria has a diverse geography, with climates ranging from arid to humid equatorial. However, Nigeriaâ€™s most diverse feature is its people. Hundreds of languages are spoken in the country, including Yoruba, Igbo, Fula, Hausa, Edo, Ibibio, Tiv, and English. The country has abundant natural resources, notably large deposits of petroleum and natural gas.
            Capital: Abuja
            Population: (2024 est.) 228,181,000
            Form Of Government: federal republic with two legislative houses (Senate [109]; House of Representatives [360])
            Official Language: English
            The national capital is Abuja, in the Federal Capital Territory, which was created by decree in 1976. Lagos, the former capital, retains its standing as the countryâ€™s leading commercial and industrial city.
            Modern Nigeria dates from 1914, when the British Protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria were joined. The country became independent on October 1, 1960, and in 1963 adopted a republican constitution but elected to stay a member of the Commonwealth.</p>
